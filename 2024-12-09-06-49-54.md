For beginners, focus on form and gradually increasing weights. Key chest exercises include:

1. Push-Ups: Bodyweight exercise to build strength and endurance.


2. Flat Bench Press: Barbell or dumbbell press on a flat bench for overall chest development.


3. Incline Bench Press: Targets the upper chest; use a barbell or dumbbells.


4. Chest Flys: Dumbbells on a flat or incline bench, focusing on chest stretch and contraction.


5. Cable Crossovers: Using a cable machine for constant tension and shaping the chest.


6. Dips (Chest-Focused): Lean forward to target the chest instead of triceps.


7. Machine Chest Press: Great for beginners to control form and reduce injury risk.



Start with light weights, 3 sets of 10â€“12 reps. Prioritize warm-ups and cool-downs.
